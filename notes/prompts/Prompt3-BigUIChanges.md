# Calendar

## Add to calendar
There should be an 'add to calendar' button (use an icon, not text) on all session cards that will add the session to the user's google calendar. Make sure this always uses the session data. It should go near the bookmark/reject buttons. Applies to both small and large session cards.

## Manage rejected items
The "You" tab should also let you see rejected items and unreject them. Same cards, but the reject button is already lit and clicking it again unrejects the item. Bookmarking also unrejects it. Applies to both sessions and speakers.

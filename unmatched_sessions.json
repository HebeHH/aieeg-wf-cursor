    "Description": "The rapid progress in LLM capability has not translated to increased reliability for business critical AI use cases. The root-cause? Data is \"not ready\".\r\nConversational analytics doesn't go beyond the analyst team because it's hard to verify if the generated queries are actually doing what they are supposed to.\r\nRAG based systems often fail to handle the breadth and depth of real world use-cases because it requires a prohibitive amount of preparation & maintenance of an underlying knowledge graph.\r\n\r\nAgentic AI systems need to hard-code specific workflows to work reliably and end up looking more like software engineering with LLM calls instead of delivering on the promise of truly agentic workflows.\r\n\r\nIn all of these failure modes, the common culprit is that the planning or reasoning done by the LLM fails to accurately capture the user's intent or the domain's context aka the lack of a well prepared semantic data layer.\r\n\r\nEnterprise data is silo-ed and vastly varying levels of quality and the perfect \"semantic layer\" and \"metadata\" is a moving target. New data is continuously being created and business definitions are rapidly changing and often entirely on-demand.\r\nIn this talk we'll share how you can build and maintain a semantic data layer that is maintained entirely by AI, and show (with live examples) how that dramatically improves reliability of the AI system that needs dynamic access to data.\r\nWe'll demonstrate how this sufficiently augments existing RAG, text-to-SQL and tool calling techniques and starts opening the door to reliable AI deployments.\r\n",
